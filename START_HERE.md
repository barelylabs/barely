# Bio Landing Page Blocks Development

## For New Claude Code Instance

1. Open Claude Code in this directory
2. Claude will read CLAUDE_PROJECT.md for immediate context
3. Check .claude/project/plan.md for implementation tasks
4. All project artifacts are available in .claude/project/

## Development Flow

- This branch is focused solely on bio-landing-page-blocks
- Use organized plan to track progress
- Original project: 0_Projects/bio-landing-page-blocks/

## Key Commands After Starting Claude Code

- Review implementation plan: Read .claude/project/plan.md
- Check requirements: Read .claude/project/PRD.md
- Understand user needs: Read .claude/project/JTBD.md

## Quick Context

**What we're building**: 4 new block types for the bio platform
1. Markdown Block - Rich text content
2. Image Block - Images with captions
3. Two-Panel Block - Image/text side-by-side
4. Cart Block - Direct checkout integration

**Why**: 10+ agency clients can't use the current MDX editor. Major client needs this for merch campaign launch.

**Timeline**: 1-2 days implementation

**Key approach**: Extend existing bio platform, reuse all patterns
