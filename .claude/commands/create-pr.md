# Create a PR

Commit all changes to the current branch, push to origin, and create a PR.

- If the branch has an "\_{issue-number}" suffix, link the PR to that issue
- Use conventional commit format for the commit message
- Include a meaningful PR description based on the changes
- Handle errors gracefully and report them to the user
