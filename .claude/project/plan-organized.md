# Barely Invoice MVP - Feature-Organized Implementation Plan

## Feature Summary

Implement a workspace-scoped invoicing system as an app variant of the barely.ai platform, enabling invoice creation, client management, email delivery, and Stripe payment collection through public payment pages.

## Architecture Overview

The invoice app will be implemented as a new app variant (`invoice`) within the existing monorepo structure, leveraging:
- Existing workspace multi-tenancy system for data isolation
- Stripe Connect infrastructure for payment processing  
- SendGrid integration for email delivery
- App variant configuration pattern established by fm/vip apps
- Shared UI components and authentication system

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **App Variant Architecture**: Use existing app variant pattern to create focused invoice interface while hiding unnecessary navigation
2. **Database Design**: Workspace-scoped tables following existing patterns with soft deletes
3. **Payment Processing**: Leverage existing Stripe Connect per workspace, avoiding new OAuth implementation
4. **Public Routes**: Implement public payment pages using established public router patterns from vip/fm apps
5. **Email Delivery**: Use SendGrid transactional API directly instead of broadcast system
6. **Status Tracking**: Implement event-driven status updates via webhooks and database triggers
7. **Invoice Numbers**: Use workspace-scoped sequential numbering with format `INV-{workspacePrefix}-{number}`

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Workspace system fully operational (Bio MVP completion)
- Stripe Connect configured per workspace
- SendGrid API available for transactional emails
- Existing auth/session management
- Shared UI component library

### Assumptions
- Users have completed workspace onboarding
- Stripe Connect is active for payment collection
- Single currency (USD) for MVP
- HTML invoice display (no PDF generation)
- No recurring billing in MVP phase
