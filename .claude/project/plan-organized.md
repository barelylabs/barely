# Technical Implementation Plan - VIP Email-Gated Downloads (Feature-Organized)

## Feature Summary

Build a high-conversion email capture system that exchanges exclusive audio content for fan email addresses, leveraging existing streaming infrastructure from barely.press and integrating with barely.email for automated nurture sequences that drive merchandise sales.

## Architecture Overview

The VIP feature will be implemented as a new Next.js app at `apps/vip` following the existing monorepo patterns. It will:
- Reuse the audio player component from barely.press
- Integrate with the workspace authentication system
- Store release metadata in PostgreSQL with new `vipReleases` and `vipAccessLogs` tables  
- Use S3 for audio file storage with presigned URLs for secure downloads
- Track all user interactions through the existing Tinybird analytics pipeline
- Trigger email sequences via the barely.email API

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Separate App vs Extension**: Create new `apps/vip` rather than extending press app to maintain clear separation of concerns and allow independent scaling
2. **Download Implementation**: Use S3 presigned URLs with 24-hour expiration rather than streaming downloads to reduce server load
3. **Email Validation**: Client-side validation with server verification to minimize invalid submissions while maintaining UX
4. **Mobile Audio Fallback**: Email delivery of download links when in-app browser audio fails, avoiding complex polyfills
5. **Analytics**: Extend existing Tinybird events rather than creating new analytics system
6. **URL Structure**: Subdomain routing (barely.vip) with Cloudflare for optimal performance

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- `@barely/press` audio player component is stable and exportable
- `@barely/email` API supports tag-based list segmentation
- `@barely/files` S3 client handles large audio files efficiently
- `@barely/db` supports new table creation without breaking changes
- Cloudflare subdomain configuration is accessible

### Assumptions
- Single track per release is sufficient for MVP
- Artists have audio files ready in standard formats (mp3, wav, flac)
- Email delivery infrastructure can handle instant confirmations at scale
- Existing workspace permissions model fits VIP use cases
