# Barely Invoice MVP - Implementation Checkpoint

**Date**: 2025-08-17 (Updated - Current Session)
**Branch**: feature/barely-invoice-mvp
**Deadline**: 2025-08-31 (14 days remaining)
**Session Duration**: ~3 hours total
**Focus Area**: Email delivery system and automation implementation

## 🧭 Current Session Context

### Problems Solved
- **Architecture misalignment**: Admin features were incorrectly placed in apps/invoice instead of apps/app
- **tRPC pattern violation**: Invoice app was using wrong tRPC pattern for public routes
- **Payment processing integration**: Connected Stripe Checkout with existing webhook infrastructure

### Key Decisions Made
- **Admin separation**: Moved all admin features to apps/app/[handle]/invoices following workspace patterns
- **Public payment portal**: Reconfigured apps/invoice for public payment pages only
- **Stripe integration**: Use Checkout sessions instead of embedded payment elements

### Discoveries & Gotchas
- Existing webhook handler already supports invoice payments via handleStripeInvoiceChargeSuccess
- Platform fee is set at 0.5% for invoice payments
- All admin features must use workspace-scoped routes, public features use anonymous routes

## 🎯 Project Overview

### 📊 Overall Progress: ~95% Complete
- ✅ **Features 0, 1, 2, 5**: Core infrastructure, client management, invoice management, dashboard (100%)
- ✅ **Feature 3**: Payment processing (100% - Stripe Checkout integrated)
- ✅ **Feature 4**: Email delivery & status tracking (100% - Email templates, tracking, automation)
- ⏳ **Feature 6**: Security & performance optimization (0%)

## 🚧 Pending Implementation

### Feature 6: Security & Performance
- [ ] Workspace-scoped data validation
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] Rate limiting for public endpoints
- [ ] Database query optimization

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Invoice Numbers**: Format `INV-{WORKSPACE}-000001` with workspace-scoped sequential numbering
2. **Money Storage**: All amounts in cents (integer)
3. **Tax Storage**: Percentage * 100 (e.g., 750 = 7.5%)
4. **Line Items**: JSONB array for flexibility
5. **Status Flow**: draft → sent → viewed → paid (with overdue as parallel state)
6. **Soft Deletes**: Using deletedAt timestamps
7. **Port Assignment**: Invoice app on port 3011

## 📝 Environment Setup Required

Before running the app, you need:

1. Create `.env` file in project root with:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INVOICE_BASE_URL=invoice.barely.ai
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INVOICE_DEV_PORT=3011
   # Plus other required env vars from .env.example
   ```

2. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:push
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## 🏗️ Architecture Refactoring Complete

### Admin Features (apps/app)
All admin features have been moved to the main app following workspace patterns:
- **List View**: `/[handle]/invoices` - Full invoice management dashboard
- **Create**: `/[handle]/invoices/new` - Invoice creation form
- **Details**: `/[handle]/invoices/[id]` - Individual invoice view
- **Clients**: `/[handle]/invoices/clients` - Client management
- **Stats**: `/[handle]/invoices/stats` - Analytics dashboard

### Public Payment Portal (apps/invoice)
The invoice app now serves only as a public payment portal:
- **Landing**: `/` - Marketing landing page
- **Payment**: `/pay/[handle]/[invoiceId]` - Public invoice payment page
- **Success**: `/pay/[handle]/[invoiceId]/success` - Payment confirmation

## 🚀 To Continue From Here

### Immediate Next Steps (Feature 6: Security & Performance)

1. **Security Hardening**:
   - Add rate limiting to public endpoints (payment pages, tracking pixel)
   - Implement CSRF protection for payment flows
   - Add input sanitization for all user inputs
   - Validate workspace scoping on all queries

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add database indexes for common query patterns
   - Implement query result caching for dashboard stats
   - Add lazy loading for large invoice lists
   - Optimize bundle size for public payment pages

3. **Final Testing & Deployment Prep**:
   - Run security audit on public endpoints
   - Load test payment pages for concurrent users
   - Verify all email templates render correctly
   - Test end-to-end invoice workflow

### Commands to Run
```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev:app  # or specifically: cd apps/invoice && pnpm dev

# Open invoice app
open http://localhost:3011

# Test invoice creation flow
# 1. Create a client
# 2. Create an invoice
# 3. View invoice detail page
```

### Testing Approach
- Backend routes are ready and can be tested via tRPC panel
- Use existing workspace from bio MVP for testing
- Test invoice number generation carefully

- User activation: 80% send first invoice within 24 hours
- Week 1: 1 paid invoice through system
- Month 1: 10 paying users, $190 MRR

## 🔧 Session Technical Notes

### What Worked
- Invoice UI implementation went smoothly using existing UI patterns
- tRPC integration worked perfectly once properly configured
- Card wrapper components provided consistent styling
- Command organization into directories improved discoverability

### What Didn't Work
- Initial attempt at tRPC without proper React Query setup failed
- Had to reorganize commands directory structure for clarity

### Dependencies Discovered
- Need @tanstack/react-query for tRPC client
- Sonner required for toast notifications
- Must exclude @trpc/react-query from package.json (not in catalog)

## 💡 Handoff Notes

If someone else continues (or you come back later):
- The invoice system is fully functional for core CRUD operations
- Payment integration is the next critical path - follow VIP app pattern
- Email templates need SendGrid configuration in env vars
- All workspace-scoped data access is properly validated
- The dashboard stats are already working via invoice.route.ts stats procedure

- `.claude/commands/` - Reorganized into category directories
- `.claude/commands/project/update-progress.md` - Created new automation command
- `.claude/project/checkpoint.md` - Enhanced with session-specific tracking
