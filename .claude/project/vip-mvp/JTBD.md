## Primary Jobs (High Priority)

### Job 1: Convert Paid Ad Traffic Into Contactable Fans

**Job Statement**  
As a marketing agency managing artist campaigns, I want to convert cold ad traffic into email subscribers, so that I can build a direct relationship with fans who have shown interest in exclusive content.

**Context**
- When running Instagram/Facebook ad campaigns for new releases or tours
- Triggered by low ROI on ads that send traffic to streaming platforms

**Motivation (Why this matters)**
- Paid ads to Spotify generate streams but no fan contact info
- Can't retarget or communicate with fans who clicked ads
- Losing 90%+ of ad spend value by not capturing contact info

**Current Alternatives (if any)**
- Toneden smart links (poor conversion, expensive)
- Custom landing pages (complex setup, no analytics)
- Bio links (too many options, diluted conversion)

**Desired Outcome / Success Criteria**
- 30%+ of ad clicks convert to email subscribers
- Immediate value exchange validates the email capture
- Clean integration with email marketing for follow-up

**Priority Level**
- High

**Motivation (Why this matters)**
