## Overview

This document identifies the core jobs that agency clients and independent artists are trying to accomplish when creating and managing landing pages for their music campaigns. The focus is on understanding *why* users need these capabilities, not just *what* features they want.

## Key Insights

### What This Is Really About

Users aren't trying to "build landing pages" - they're trying to:
- **Tell compelling stories** that connect with fans emotionally
- **Maintain creative control** over their marketing narrative  
- **React quickly** to market opportunities
- **Remove friction** from the fan-to-customer journey

### Critical Realization

The job isn't about having a page builder - it's about having **creative autonomy** and **marketing agility**. The current MDX editor fails not because it lacks features, but because it creates dependency where users need independence.

### Competitive Context

When users hire Beacons.ai or Carrd for this job, they're not hiring them for advanced features - they're hiring them for:
- **Immediate usability** without training
- **Visual confidence** in the output
- **Speed of iteration** during campaigns
- **Independence** from technical support

## Job Stories Mapped to Solution

| Job | Current Approach | New Solution | Outcome |
|-----|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| Tell story | Fight with MDX formatting | Markdown block with familiar editor | Stories flow naturally |
| Launch independently | Wait for support | Self-service block editor | Launch on your timeline |
| Showcase visuals | Markdown image syntax | Visual image & 2-panel blocks | Professional layouts instantly |
| Direct sales | External cart links | Native cart block | Seamless checkout flow |

## Conclusion

The core job isn't "create landing pages" - it's **"maintain creative and operational control over campaign narratives while removing every point of friction between fan interest and fan action."**

The bio engine block extensions directly address this by transforming a technical task (editing MDX) into a creative task (crafting compelling content), enabling users to focus on what they do best - connecting with fans and driving sales.
