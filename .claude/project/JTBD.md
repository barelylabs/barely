---

## Primary Jobs (High Priority)

### JTBD 1: Focus on Single Workflow Without Distraction

**Job Statement**  
As an independent artist focused on streaming analytics, I want to access only FM-related features when working on my streaming data, so that I can stay focused on analyzing my music performance without getting distracted by unrelated features.

**Context**

- When I'm specifically working on understanding my streaming metrics
- When I've dedicated time to analyze my Spotify/Apple Music performance
- Triggered by checking streaming stats or preparing for release strategy

**Motivation (Why this matters)**

- Cognitive overload from seeing 15+ navigation items when I only need 2-3
- Getting distracted by other features (email, merch, press) when trying to focus on streaming data
- Wanting a "streaming analytics mode" that eliminates decision fatigue

**Current Alternatives (if any)**

- Manually ignoring irrelevant navigation items
- Bookmarking specific FM pages to avoid the main dashboard
- Using separate analytics tools outside of barely.ai

**Desired Outcome / Success Criteria**

- Clean, minimal interface showing only FM pages, basic settings, and media management
- Faster task completion without navigation overwhelm
- Reduced cognitive load during focused work sessions

**Priority Level**

- High
