## Primary Jobs

### JTBD #1: Central Hub Management

**Job Statement**  
As an independent artist, I want to maintain one central link that showcases all my important content, so that I can direct fans from any platform to everything I offer without constantly updating multiple bio links.

**Context**
- When posting on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or Twitter
- When releasing new music, announcing shows, or launching merch
- During interviews or podcast appearances

**Motivation (Why this matters)**
- Social platforms limit bio links (usually just one)
- Content changes frequently (new releases, tour dates, merch drops)
- Managing multiple links across platforms is time-consuming and error-prone

**Current Alternatives**
- Linktree or similar services (requires separate paid account)
- Direct link to one thing (misses other opportunities)
- Constantly changing the single bio link (confuses fans)

**Desired Outcome / Success Criteria**
- One link that never changes but always shows current content
- Fans can easily find what they're looking for
- Updates propagate instantly without touching social profiles

**Priority Level**
- High

### JTBD #2: Fan Data Capture

**Job Statement**  
As an independent artist, I want to convert bio visitors into email subscribers, so that I can build direct relationships with fans instead of relying on social media algorithms.

**Context**
- When fans click bio link from social discovery
- After viral moments or playlist additions
- During promotional campaigns

**Motivation (Why this matters)**
- Social media reach is declining (2-5% organic reach)
- Can't export followers from social platforms
- Email lists are the only "owned" fan relationships
- Current bio tools don't capture visitor information

**Current Alternatives**
- Separate email signup forms (extra clicks, lower conversion)
- Losing these potential fans forever
- Paying for Linktree + email service integration

**Desired Outcome / Success Criteria**
- Seamless email capture without leaving bio page
- 20%+ visitor-to-subscriber conversion rate
- Automatic welcome sequences triggered
- Fans feel they're getting value, not being spammed

**Priority Level**
- High

### JTBD #3: Understanding Fan Behavior

**Job Statement**  
As an independent artist, I want to see which content my fans engage with most, so that I can make informed decisions about what to promote and create.

**Context**
- After posting new content or announcements
- When planning release strategies
- During campaign performance reviews
- When deciding what merch to produce

**Motivation (Why this matters)**
- Currently flying blind with Linktree basic analytics
- Can't connect bio clicks to actual conversions (streams, sales)
- Missing insights about which traffic sources convert best
- Paying extra for basic analytics that should be free

**Current Alternatives**
- Linktree Pro ($5-20/month) for basic analytics
- Google Analytics (too complex for most artists)
- Guessing based on social media engagement

**Desired Outcome / Success Criteria**
- Clear view of click-through rates by link
- Understanding of traffic sources and conversion paths
- Integrated with other barely.ai analytics
- Actionable insights, not just numbers

**Priority Level**
- High

## Secondary Jobs

### JTBD #4: Quick Setup and Maintenance

**Job Statement**  
As a less tech-savvy artist, I want to set up my bio page quickly without design skills, so that I can focus on making music instead of wrestling with technology.

**Context**
- During initial artist onboarding
- When working with managers/agencies
- Before major releases or campaigns

**Motivation (Why this matters)**
- 50% of artists struggle with tech setup
- Time spent on tech is time away from music
- Fear of "doing it wrong" prevents getting started

**Current Alternatives**
- Hiring someone to set it up
- Using basic/ugly default templates
- Avoiding bio links altogether

**Desired Outcome / Success Criteria**
- Setup complete in under 5 minutes
- Professional look without customization
- Confidence that it "just works"

**Priority Level**
- Medium

### JTBD #5: Remarketing Enablement

**Job Statement**  
As an artist running paid ads, I want to retarget bio visitors with relevant ads, so that I can maximize ROI on my advertising spend.

**Context**
- Running Facebook/Instagram ad campaigns
- Promoting new releases or tours
- Building audiences for future campaigns

**Motivation (Why this matters)**
- Bio visitors are high-intent fans
- Retargeting converts 10x better than cold traffic
- Currently paying Linktree just for pixel access

**Current Alternatives**
- Paying for Linktree Pro + manual pixel setup
- Missing retargeting opportunities entirely
- Complex manual pixel installation

**Desired Outcome / Success Criteria**
- Automatic pixel firing on all bio visits
- Segmented audiences based on link clicks
- Integration with ad platforms

**Priority Level**
- Medium

### JTBD #6: Brand Consistency

**Job Statement**  
As an artist building my brand, I want my bio page to match my aesthetic, so that fans have a cohesive experience across all touchpoints.

**Context**
- Part of overall brand/visual identity
- During rebrand or aesthetic shifts
- When working with designers/creative teams

**Motivation (Why this matters)**
- First impression for many new fans
- Linktree pages look generic
- Brand consistency builds recognition

**Current Alternatives**
- Linktree themes (limited options)
- Custom website (too complex/expensive)
- Accepting generic look

**Desired Outcome / Success Criteria**
- Themes that match artist vibe
- Consistent with other barely.ai pages
- Professional without custom design

**Priority Level**
- Low (for MVP)
