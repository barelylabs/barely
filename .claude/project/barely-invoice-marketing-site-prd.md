**Headline**

```
You're Not an Accountant. Stop Using Accountant Software.
```

**Three-Column Problems**

```
Column 1: "Too Many Steps"
QuickBooks requires 47 clicks to create an invoice. FreshBooks needs 23.
You just want to tell someone what they owe you.

Column 2: "Chasing Payments"
"Did you get my invoice?" "Just following up..." "Checking in again..."
Sound familiar? You're a creator, not a collections agent.

Column 3: "Zero Recurring Revenue"
Invoice. Wait. Get paid. Chase. Repeat.
Every month starts at $0. No predictability, constant income anxiety.

**Our Story** (Instead of testimonials for now)

```
"We built Barely Invoice because we were tired of spending more time
billing clients than doing the work they hired us for. After trying
every invoicing tool out there, we realized they're all built for
accountants, not creators. So we built our own."

- The Barely Team
```

### 9. FAQ Section

**Headline**

```
Questions? We've Barely Got Answers
```

**FAQs**

```
Q: Do I need a Stripe account?
A: Yes, we use Stripe Connect for payments. It takes 5 minutes to set up and means your money goes directly to you, not through us.

Q: Can I import clients from QuickBooks?
A: Not yet. We're keeping things simple. Copy-paste works great for now.

Q: What about taxes and accounting?
A: We're invoicing software, not accounting software. Export your data to CSV for your accountant.

Q: Can clients pay without creating an account?
A: Yes! They just click "Pay Now" and enter their card. No friction.

Q: Is there a mobile app?
A: The web app works perfectly on mobile. Native apps are on the roadmap.

Q: What if I need more than invoicing?
A: Check out our other Barely tools, or stick with us - we're launching expenses next.
