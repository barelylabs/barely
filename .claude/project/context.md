# Feature Context: Brooklyn-Forward Website Updates for barely.nyc

Generated: 2025-08-01
Search Terms: Brooklyn, brooklyn, NYC, nyc, barely.nyc, website, rebrand

## üéØ Executive Summary

The barely.nyc website (apps/nyc) has already undergone a technical rebrand from barelysparrow.com but currently lacks Brooklyn-forward messaging and positioning. The marketing strategy calls for stronger geographic positioning to differentiate Barely as a Brooklyn-based agency with authentic music scene credibility, not just another faceless tech platform.
