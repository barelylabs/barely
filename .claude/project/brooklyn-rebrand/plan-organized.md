# Technical Implementation Plan - Brooklyn + PhD Balanced Positioning (Feature-Organized)

## Feature Summary
Implement copy updates across the barely.nyc website to add subtle Brooklyn-based positioning alongside existing PhD/scientific messaging, with A/B testing infrastructure for email signatures to validate positioning effectiveness.

## Architecture Overview
This implementation involves content updates to the Next.js app at `/apps/nyc` with minimal architectural changes. The primary modifications include:
- Copy updates across React components (homepage, about, services pages)
- New footer component for location markers
- Email signature A/B testing configuration
- Analytics event tracking for positioning performance
- SEO metadata updates with location schema

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Copy-only approach**: No new UI components or design system changes to minimize risk and complexity
- **Footer creation**: Add a minimal footer component since none exists currently
- **Client-side A/B testing**: Implement email signature variants through existing email platform rather than custom solution
- **Analytics via events**: Use existing analytics infrastructure with custom events rather than new tracking system
- **Incremental rollout**: Test positioning via email signatures before full website implementation

## Dependencies & Assumptions
- Next.js app structure remains stable during implementation
- Email platform (likely Resend based on codebase) supports signature variants
- Analytics infrastructure already configured (needs verification)
- No design system changes required (Brooklyn logo already exists)
- Content updates won't affect existing test coverage
