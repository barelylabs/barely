# Brooklyn + PhD Balanced Positioning – PRD

### TL;DR

A strategic positioning update for barely.nyc that adds subtle Brooklyn location credibility to enhance the existing PhD/scientific messaging. This copy-only update targets independent artists (0-50K monthly listeners) who need both cultural understanding and technical expertise from their marketing partners. The feature enables A/B testing of positioning approaches before the agency's cold outreach soft launch.

## Goals

### Business Goals

- Improve cold email reply rates by addressing the "tech bro" trust barrier
- Differentiate from both pure tech platforms and traditional publicists
- Test positioning hypotheses with minimal investment before scaling outreach

### User Goals

- Quickly assess if the agency understands indie music culture (not just data)
- Verify legitimate expertise without feeling like it's "just another tech solution"
- Confirm the agency can help artists worldwide, not just NYC locals

### Non-Goals

- Complete website redesign or heavy Brooklyn theming
- Creating fake office presence or venue partnerships
- Limiting services to NYC-area artists only
- Removing or diminishing PhD/scientific positioning

## Narrative

*Sarah, an indie folk artist from Portland with 15K monthly listeners, is tired of wasting money on marketing that doesn't work. She's tried playlist pitchers (scam), publicists (no results), and DIY tools (too time-consuming).*

*She receives a cold email from Barely: "Brooklyn-based, PhD-backed music marketing for independent artists worldwide." Intrigued by the unusual combination, she clicks through.*

*The website immediately feels different. It's not another Silicon Valley tech platform trying to automate everything. The founder's story resonates - a scientist who played Pianos and Arlene's, who understands both the art and the analytics.*

*Sarah books a call, feeling confident that finally, here's someone who gets the indie music struggle but has the technical chops to actually solve it. The Brooklyn credibility signals she's not just another number, while the PhD background promises real results.*

- **Risk:** Seeming inauthentic if venue claims questioned
  - **Mitigation:** Use only verifiable venues, natural integration
