# Integration Record: Bio Engine Block Extensions

**Date**: 2025-08-28
**Feature**: Bio Engine Block Extensions for Landing Pages
**Integrated Into**: [[0_Projects/bio-mvp]]
**Integration Type**: Feature Extension (Merge)

## Integration Summary

The bio engine block extensions feature was successfully integrated into the existing bio-mvp project as a natural evolution of the platform from simple bio links to a comprehensive content platform.

## Key Decisions

1. **Merge vs New Project**: Chose to merge because:
   - 95% scope overlap with bio-mvp
   - Direct technical dependency on bio engine
   - Same target users and use cases
   - Natural feature progression

2. **Artifact Organization**: 
   - Kept original bio artifacts as foundation
   - Added landing page artifacts with clear naming
   - Created integration notes for traceability

3. **Timeline Impact**:
   - No change to original deadline (2025-10-31)
   - Block extensions can parallel with Features 3-7
   - 1-2 day implementation estimate aligns with timeline

## Scope Changes

### Expanded Scope
- Platform now handles both bio links AND landing pages
- 4 new block types for content creation
- Direct checkout capability via Cart blocks
- Replaces MDX editor for agency landing pages

### Success Criteria Added
- 80% migration from MDX editor
- 0 support tickets for edits
- <30 min to published page
- Major agency client launch

## Technical Integration

- Extends existing `BioBlockType` enum
- Reuses modal editor patterns
- Leverages existing rendering pipeline
- No new infrastructure required

- `PRD.md` → `bio-mvp/artifacts/PRD-landing-pages.md`
- `plan-organized.md` → `bio-mvp/artifacts/plan-landing-pages.md`

### Project Updates

4. Test with agency client campaign

## Notes

This integration represents a strategic expansion of the bio platform's capabilities, positioning it as the only tool artists need for their web presence. The immediate revenue opportunity with the waiting agency client validates the timing of this integration.
