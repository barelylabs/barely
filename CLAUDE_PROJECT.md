## Current Development
Working on: Complete rebrand from barely.io to barely.ai and Barely Sparrow to Barely NYC with Brooklyn-forward positioning
Deadline: August 15, 2025

## Current Focus
Week 2: Brooklyn positioning implementation for barely.nyc website

First tasks from plan:
1. Email Signature A/B Testing System - Test positioning before full rollout
2. Analytics & Measurement Infrastructure - Enable tracking before changes
3. Initial Trust Signals - Homepage and footer for immediate impact

## Key Technical Decisions
- Copy-only approach: No new UI components or design system changes
- Test-first validation: Email signature A/B testing before website rollout
- Lighter Brooklyn touch: Subtle positioning that enhances PhD credibility
- Analytics via events: Use existing infrastructure with custom events
