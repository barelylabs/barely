# barely.io

[barely.io](https://barely.io) is the open-source marketing stack for creators.

# Our Mission

To enable a thriving middle class of indie creators.

# Introduction

Life as an independent creator can sometimes feel exhausting or even futile. As an indie musician, I've spent countless hours crafting songs, only to find - much to my frustration - that no one was listening. In attempts to gain exposure, Iâ€™ve squandered both time and money on various marketing schemes and tools that ultimately had no substantial impact.

Although my band eventually learned [methods](https://indepreneur.io) that significantly increased our following, we found it easier to boost 'vanity' metrics (such as followers and monthly listeners) rather than building a sustainable business. The challenge lies in the accumulating costs of different tools needed for these tasks. Mailchimp for emails, ThriveCart for sales funnels, SquareSpace for website, and Shopify for an online store can add up to hundreds of dollars each month. While these expenses may be manageable for creators generating significant revenue, they can be prohibitive for beginners. Itâ€™s also just daunting to determine the best way to start generating income.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m building [barely.io](https://barely.io), an open-source toolset designed to help creators like myself build a following and start generating revenue as early as possible. It offers no marketing gimmicks or shortcuts, just simple, opinionated tools designed to help creators grow a fanbase and convert that fanbase into revenue.

These are the tools that I wanted (and still want!) for growing a creator-based business. Users have the option to either self-host or choose to host on [barely.io](https://barely.io/). Self-hosting will always remain free, while the pricing for our paid plans will primarily depend on usage, closely related to earnings. Our aim is to provide tools that are affordable to get started with and can quickly generate momentum.

# Features

## WIP

These are features that are currently used by Barely Sparrow, our marketing agency.

On the make-it-work / make-it-nice / make-it-fast spectrum, these are pushing towards â€˜make-it-niceâ€™. The UI is buggy, performance can be improved, but the features generally work. The goal is to clean these up in Q2 2024.
