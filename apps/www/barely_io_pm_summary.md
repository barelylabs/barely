### 4. Tool Stack Replacement Messaging

**Problem/Solution Section:**

```
"Ready to build your musical empire with tools that actually work together?"

Most platforms force you to choose between:
‚ùå Expensive tool stacks with fragmented data across 6+ platforms
‚ùå Generic business tools that don't understand music careers
‚ùå All-in-one platforms that sacrifice quality for convenience
‚ùå Black-box services where you never know how things actually work

Here's what you actually deserve:
‚úÖ Professional-grade tools designed specifically for musicians
‚úÖ Complete integration showing real ROI on every campaign
‚úÖ Open-source transparency so you understand exactly how everything works
‚úÖ A platform that scales from bedroom to label-level operations
```

### 5. Tool Stack Cost Calculator

**Interactive Calculator showing:**

- Linkfire Pro: $27/month
- ConvertKit: $50/month
- Squarespace: $36/month
- Basic Analytics: $20/month
- **Total: $133/month**

barely.io Rising: $79/month
**You Save: $54/month ($648/year)**

### 6. Connection to Barely Sparrow

**"Built by Barely Sparrow" Section:**

```
"The Same Tools We Use for Professional Music Marketing"

barely.io powers the marketing campaigns at Barely Sparrow, where we've helped indie artists grow from 0 to 30K+ monthly listeners. Every feature was built to solve real problems we encountered in professional music marketing.

Now you get the exact same tools we use for agency clients - transparent, integrated, and engineered specifically for how music careers actually grow.
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### New Pages Needed

1. `/` (Homepage)
2. `/pricing` (Detailed tier comparison)
3. `/features` (Core features overview)
4. `/vs-linkfire` (Competitor comparison)
5. `/vs-convertkit` (Email marketing comparison)
6. `/vs-squarespace` (Landing page comparison)
7. `/getting-started` (Onboarding flow)

### Key Components

- Interactive pricing table with tier comparison
- Tool stack cost calculator (dynamic)
- Career progression timeline (Free ‚Üí Bedroom ‚Üí Rising ‚Üí Breakout ‚Üí Label)
- Feature comparison grids vs. competitors
- Integration showcase (how tools work together)
- Open source badges and GitHub links

### Features Section Content

**Core Capabilities:**

- üîó Smart Links & Pre-Saves (replaces Linkfire/Feature.fm)
- üìß Email Marketing & Automation (replaces ConvertKit/Mailchimp)
- üåê Landing Pages & EPKs (replaces Squarespace/Bandzoogle)
- üõí Merch & Direct Sales (replaces Shopify/Big Cartel)
- üìä Unified Analytics (replaces Google Analytics/Chartmetric)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Marketing Automation (replaces Zapier workflows)

### Integration Messaging

**Why Integration Matters:**

```
Most artists use 6-8 separate tools. Here's what happens:
- You run a Facebook ad that drives traffic to a Linkfire link
- Some fans pre-save on Spotify, others visit your Squarespace site
- A few buy merch through Big Cartel, some join your ConvertKit list
- You have no idea which ad drove which result

With barely.io:
- Same Facebook ad drives traffic to your barely.io smart link
- Fan behavior tracked across pre-saves, website visits, purchases, and email signups
- You see exactly which $5 ad spend generated which $50 merch sale
```

### Cross-Site Integration
