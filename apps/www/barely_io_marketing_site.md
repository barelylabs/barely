### Integration Story

**Why Integration Matters More Than Individual Features**

Most artists use 6-8 separate tools. Here's what happens:

- You run a Facebook ad that drives traffic to a Linkfire link
- Some fans pre-save on Spotify, others visit your Squarespace site
- A few buy merch through Big Cartel, some join your ConvertKit list
- You have **no idea which ad drove which result**

With barely.io:

- Same Facebook ad drives traffic to your barely.io smart link
- Fan behavior tracked across pre-saves, website visits, purchases, and email signups
- **You see exactly which $5 ad spend generated which $50 merch sale**

## About Page

### Connection to Barely Sparrow

**The Tools Behind the Strategy**

barely.io powers the marketing campaigns at Barely Sparrow, our music marketing agency. Every feature was built to solve real problems we encountered helping indie artists grow from 0-30K monthly listeners.

**Why We Built This:**

- Existing tools were built for general marketing, not music careers
- Tool stacks cost more than most indie artists' monthly income
- No platform showed the real ROI of marketing campaigns
- Musicians spent more time managing tools than making music

### Open Source Philosophy

**Transparency in Tools and Methods**

Unlike other platforms, barely.io is open source. You can see exactly how everything works, contribute features, or even self-host if you prefer. No black boxes, no vendor lock-in.
