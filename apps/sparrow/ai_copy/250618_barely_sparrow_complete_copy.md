- ‚ùå Black-box services that hide how they actually work

**Here's what actually works:**
- ‚úÖ Data-driven campaigns with transparent reporting

### Founder Story Teaser

*"After spending years in research labs optimizing materials at the molecular level, I realized musicians faced the same problem - incredible art buried under inefficient systems. So I left science to build the tools and methods that help artists break through the noise."*

## About Page: "From Lab to Studio"

### Page Header
**The PhD Who Left Science to Fix Music Marketing**
*Building transparent tools so indie artists can focus on what they do best*

### The Lab Years
I spent years in research labs optimizing materials at the molecular level. PhD in Materials Science, degrees in Physics and Mechanical Engineering. I thought I'd spend my career perfecting atomic structures and publishing papers.

But I had a problem.

### The Artist Problem
I was also a musician. Spent nights writing songs, weekends recording, months crafting albums that I was genuinely proud of. Released 4-5 painstakingly crafted records that got... tens of listeners.

*Tens.*

There are billions of people in the world. I knew that even a tiny fraction who'd connect with my music could be an enormous audience. But somehow, incredible art was getting buried under completely inefficient systems.

### The Connection
It hit me: this was the same problem I'd been solving in the lab. Amazing potential - whether it's a new material or a great song - getting lost because the systems around it weren't optimized.

The difference? In music, no one was applying engineering principles to fix it.

### The Decision
So I left science to science the hell out of music marketing.

I built barely.io from scratch - not just another dashboard, but a completely open-source platform where you can see exactly how everything works. Started testing every assumption about how artists grow, treating each campaign like a controlled experiment.

### The Mission
My job isn't to be the star of your story. I'm the engineer who builds the stage, tunes the sound system, and optimizes the lighting so you can focus on what you do best: creating art that matters.

You handle the music, the fan connections, the creative vision. I handle the algorithms, the data analysis, and all the technical stuff that makes sure your music finds the people who'll love it.

### Why This Matters
The music industry is full of black-box services that charge thousands while hiding how they actually work. Meanwhile, indie artists get burned by expensive publicists and risky playlist schemes that violate platform terms.

There's a better way: transparent tools, data-driven strategies, and honest reporting about what's actually working.
