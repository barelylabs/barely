# Hero's Journey Framework for Product Marketing

## Core Principle

**The customer is the hero, not your product.** Your role is to be the mentor/guide who helps them achieve transformation.

---

## The 6-Step Framework

### 1. Identify Your Hero

**Who:** Your customer (not your product)
**Goal:** Understand who they are, what they want, and what they struggle with

**Implementation:**

- Use customer research, personas, and empathy maps
- Create a profile of your ideal hero
- Craft messaging that speaks to their needs, goals, and emotions
- Focus the story on the hero, not the mentor

### 2. Establish the Status Quo

**What:** The ordinary world where your hero faces a problem your product can solve
**Goal:** Show how this problem affects their life and why they're dissatisfied

**Implementation:**

- Show what they've tried before and why it didn't work
- Use data, anecdotes, or testimonials to illustrate the status quo
- Create contrast between current state and desired state
- Present two pathways: success with your solution vs. failure without it

### 3. Present the Call to Action

**What:** The event/message that invites your hero to try your product
**Goal:** Make this call compelling, clear, and easy to act upon

**Implementation:**

- Can be a trigger, recommendation, promotion, or demonstration
- Highlight benefits, features, or value propositions
- Show how your product helps overcome their problem or achieve their goal
- Eliminate potential barriers
- Make the "why" behind your solution apparent and easy to understand

### 4. Introduce the Mentor

**Who:** Your company, support team, community, or educational resources
**Goal:** Provide guidance, support, and credibility to overcome doubts and fears

**Implementation:**

- Position as the guide, not the hero
- Use social proof, case studies, or best practices
- Show how the mentor provides support, advice, and feedback
- Use credentials only where they add value
- Focus on helping the hero overcome obstacles

### 5. Show the Transformation

**What:** The result/outcome your hero achieves after using your product
**Goal:** Demonstrate how this transformation improves their life

**Implementation:**

- Show changes in behavior, attitude, or situation
- Use metrics, stories, or visuals to demonstrate transformation
- Create positive emotion around the outcome
- Focus on whether the product solved the original problem mentioned in status quo
- Highlight how their life is better now

### 6. Encourage the Return

**What:** The stage where your hero shares their transformation and becomes an advocate
**Goal:** Create a loop of loyalty and growth

**Implementation:**

- Make it easy and rewarding for customers to spread the word
- Use referrals, reviews, or testimonials to incentivize sharing
- Turn satisfied customers into advocates
- Amplify their success stories
- Create community around shared transformation

## Key Expert Insights & Best Practices

### Positioning Guidelines

- **Hero Focus:** "Your hero is not your product, but your customer"
- **Mentor Role:** "The focus of your story should be on the hero, not the mentor"
- **Transformation Validation:** "Did it solve for what it went out to do as mentioned in the status quo"

### Messaging Strategy

- **Two-Path Approach:** Always present "what happens with your solution vs. without it"
- **Emotional Connection:** Evoke emotion, align with customer values, showcase benefits
- **Clear Resolution:** Provide a definitive outcome that resolves the initial problem

### Implementation Tips

- **Eliminate Barriers:** Make calls-to-action simple and remove friction
- **Use Credentials Wisely:** Only highlight mentor credentials where they add genuine value
- **Measure Impact:** Focus on concrete outcomes and transformations
- **Build Community:** Encourage customers to share their journey with others

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Making your product the hero instead of the customer
- Overemphasizing mentor credentials at expense of hero's journey
- Unclear or complex calls-to-action
- Focusing on features instead of transformation outcomes
- Not connecting the transformation back to the original problem

## Questions to Ask When Crafting Your Story

1. **Hero Identification:** Who exactly is our customer and what do they struggle with?
2. **Status Quo:** What specific problems do they face without our solution?
3. **Call to Action:** What makes our invitation compelling and easy to accept?
4. **Mentor Credibility:** How do we establish trust without overshadowing the hero?
5. **Transformation Proof:** What concrete evidence shows our solution works?
6. **Advocacy Path:** How do we make it easy for satisfied customers to share their success?

Remember: The goal is to position your customer as the hero of their own transformation story, with your product/service as the trusted guide that helps them achieve their desired outcome.
