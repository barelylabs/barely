When I first started marketing music seriously, my browser had 47 tabs open.

Linkfire for smart links. ConvertKit for email. Squarespace for landing pages. Google Analytics for tracking. Shopify for merch. Facebook Ads Manager. Instagram insights. Spotify for Artists. A spreadsheet trying to make sense of it all.

Every Monday, I'd spend 3 hours just gathering data from different platforms. By the time I had insights, the moment to act on them had passed.

## The Problem: Death by a Thousand Platforms

Here's what most artists' tech stacks look like:

- **Smart Links**: Linkfire, Feature.fm, or Linktree ($9-50/month)
- **Email Marketing**: Mailchimp or ConvertKit ($30-100/month)
- **Website/Landing Pages**: Squarespace or Wix ($18-40/month)
- **E-commerce**: Shopify or Bandcamp ($30+/month + fees)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (free but complex)
- **Link Shortening**: Bitly ($10-30/month)
- **EPKs**: Sonicbids or manual PDFs ($10+/month)

Total: $100-300/month in subscriptions, plus hours of manual work connecting dots between platforms.

But the real cost isn't money - it's missed opportunities. When your Instagram post drives Spotify streams that lead to merch sales, but you can't track that journey, you can't optimize it.

## The Solution: barely.io

After helping dozens of artists navigate this mess, I built barely.io - not just another tool to add to your stack, but a complete replacement that brings everything together.

Here's the exact feature set we use for every campaign:

### Content Management

- **media**: Upload and manage images, videos, audio files in one place
- **tracks**: Centralized music catalog management
- **mixtapes**: Create collections and playlists for different campaigns

### Marketing Destinations

- **links**: Smart short links (like dub.co) that route fans from artist.link/song to any destination
- **fm**: Streaming smart links showing all platform options for a release
- **pages**: Markdown-driven landing pages optimized for single actions
- **press**: Professional EPKs for media outreach

### E-commerce & Merch

- **products**: Physical and digital product management
- **carts**: Custom checkout flows with pay-what-you-want options
- **orders**: Complete order management and fulfillment tracking

### Email Marketing

- **templates**: Reusable email designs
- **template groups**: Organize by campaign type
- **Automated flows**: Event-triggered sequences (e.g., welcome series after CD purchase)

### Fan Management

- **fans**: Central database of all contacts and behavior
- **fan groups**: Segment audiences based on purchases, engagement, location

### Automation & Analytics

- **flows**: Visual automation builder for multi-step campaigns
- **Built-in analytics**: Track everything in one dashboard
- **Attribution tracking**: See which campaigns drive which outcomes

## Why Integration Beats Features

The magic isn't in having these features - it's in having them talk to each other:

1. **Fan visits smart link** → System captures their data
2. **Fan streams on Spotify** → Triggers email sequence
3. **Fan opens email** → Sees personalized merch offer
4. **Fan purchases** → Automatically tagged for future campaigns
5. **You see entire journey** → In one dashboard, with clear attribution

No CSV exports. No manual tagging. No lost data between platforms.

## Real Campaign Example

Here's how we used this stack for Proper Youth's latest campaign:

### Week 1: Content Prep

- Uploaded 30 iPhone performance videos to **media**
- Created smart links for each song using **links**
- Built landing page for free CD offer using **pages**

### Week 2: Launch

- Posted to Instagram with trackable links
- **flows** automatically captured visitor data
- Email sequence triggered for new fans
- Cart campaigns launched for warm audiences

### Results Tracking

- Instagram post → 2,341 link clicks
- Link clicks → 1,832 Spotify streams
- Spotify listeners → 234 email signups
- Email list → 67 merch purchases
- Total revenue: $2,510
- Time spent on tracking: 15 minutes

All in one dashboard. All automatically connected.

## The Open-Source Difference

Unlike other platforms, barely.io is completely open-source. You can:

- See exactly how attribution works
- Understand the algorithms
- Self-host if you want maximum control
- Contribute features you need

No black boxes. No "proprietary algorithms." Just transparent tools that work.

## Pricing That Makes Sense

Instead of paying for 10 different tools:

- **Indie** ($24/month): Everything you need to start
- **Rising** ($59/month): Advanced features for growing artists
- **Breakout** ($149/month): Premium tools for scaling

Most artists save $100-200/month just in subscription costs. But the real value? Actually understanding your growth instead of guessing.

## The Bottom Line

You can keep juggling multiple platforms, exporting CSVs, and missing connections between your marketing efforts.

Or you can use a system built specifically for how music marketing actually works - where every tool talks to every other tool, and you can see the full picture of your growth.

_P.S. - Yes, you can still use your favorite tools alongside barely.io. We play nice with others. But once you see what true integration looks like, you might not want to._
