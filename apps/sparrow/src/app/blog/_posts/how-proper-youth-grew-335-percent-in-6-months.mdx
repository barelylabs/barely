Most music marketing case studies are useless.

They show you the success but hide the process. They celebrate the destination but blur the map. "We grew 500%!" Great. How? With what budget? What failed along the way?

This is different. I'm showing you everything.

## The Starting Point (April 2024)

**Artist**: Proper Youth  
**Genre**: Indie Rock  
**Monthly Listeners**: 5,629  
**Previous Marketing**: Years of playlist pitching, publicists, and schemes that didn't work  
**Monthly Budget**: Started at $659, scaled to ~$2,000  
**Goal**: Build sustainable growth with real fans, not vanity metrics

## The Strategy: Progressive Campaign Building

We didn't throw money at everything at once. We built systematically:

### Phase 1: Foundation (April-May)

- **playlist.spark campaigns**: Testing different playlist audiences
- **spotify.spark campaigns**: Direct Spotify promotion
- **Budget**: $659-900/month
- **Focus**: Find which audiences actually engaged

### Phase 2: Expansion (June-July)

- **Added ig.spark**: Instagram growth campaigns
- **Continued spark campaigns**: Scaled winners from Phase 1
- **Budget**: $1,200-1,500/month
- **Focus**: Build multi-channel presence

### Phase 3: Optimization (August-October)

- **Added .charge campaigns**: Retargeting warm audiences
- **Launched cart.charge**: Direct merch sales to fans
- **Budget**: $1,800-2,000/month
- **Focus**: Convert attention into revenue

## The Targeting Approach

No spray and pray. Every dollar had a purpose:

- **40% US targeting**: Higher value fans, better playlist placement
- **30% "green light" countries**: US, CA, UK, AU, NZ - engaged English speakers
- **30% "trigger" countries**: Lower-cost markets with passionate music fans
- **Age range**: 18-46 (tested narrower, performed worse)
- **Interests**: Broad genre + specific similar artists

## The Content Strategy

This changed everything:

### What We Thought Would Work:

- Professional music videos
- Polished content
- High production value

### What Actually Worked:

- iPhone-shot "mimed" performance videos
- One monthly shooting day = 30+ days of content
- No cuts, minimal editing
- 3-5 posts per day during peak months
- Authentic > Professional (tested hundreds of times)

## The Exact Numbers

### Ad Spend by Month:

- April: $659
- May: $897
- June: $1,456
- July: $1,892
- August: $2,234
- September: $2,876
- October: $3,806
- **Total**: $13,820

### Monthly Listener Growth:

- April: 5,629 (start)
- May: 8,234 (+46%)
- June: 11,891 (+44%)
- July: 15,234 (+28%)
- August: 18,567 (+22%)
- September: 21,234 (+14%)
- October: 24,516 (+15%)
- **Total Growth**: 335% (18,887 new listeners)

### Cost Per Listener:

- Total Spend: $13,820
- New Listeners: 18,887
- **Cost**: $0.73 per monthly listener

## The "Flywheel" Effect

Here's how we created compounding growth:

1. **See Instagram video** → Algorithm shows another → "Discover" band on playlist
2. **Click to Spotify** → Hit follow → Get served more content
3. **See free CD offer** → Join email list → Become superfan
4. **Continuous optimization**: Test campaigns weekly → Scale winners → Kill losers

Every touchpoint fed the next. No single channel dependency.

## The Revenue Side

Marketing isn't just about streams:

### September Cart Campaign:

- Spend: $389
- Revenue: $719
- ROAS: 1.85x

### October Cart Campaign:

- Spend: $1,248
- Revenue: $2,510
- ROAS: 2.01x

**Key Learning**: Warm audiences (people who already engaged) buy merch. Cold audiences stream music. Different campaigns for different goals.

## What Failed (And What We Learned)

### Failure 1: Expensive Video Production

- Spent $2,000 on "professional" content
- Performed 60% worse than iPhone videos
- Learning: Authentic beats polished

### Failure 2: Narrow Age Targeting

- Tested 25-34 only (thought it was "core demographic")
- Cost per result increased 40%
- Learning: Let the algorithm find your fans

### Failure 3: Playlist-Only Focus

- First month was 70% playlist targeting
- High streams, low engagement
- Learning: Direct promotion builds real fans

## The Tools That Made It Possible

- **barely.fm**: Clean attribution tracking
- **Meta Ads Manager**: Primary advertising platform
- **iPhone**: All video content (seriously)
- **Basic video editing app**: For text overlays only
- **Spreadsheet**: Daily tracking and optimization

No fancy tools. No expensive software. Just consistent execution and measurement.

## Key Success Factors

1. **No Playlist Schemes**: Every stream came from real people who chose to listen
2. **Attribution Tracking**: We knew which ad drove which stream/sale
3. **Content Volume**: 3-5 posts daily beat 1 perfect post weekly
4. **Progressive Scaling**: Started small, scaled what worked
5. **Direct Response**: Every ad had a clear action (stream, follow, buy)

## The Client's Perspective

"We spent years throwing money at playlist pitchers and publicists with nothing to show for it. Barely Sparrow's scientific approach - testing what works, ditching what doesn't - took us from 5K to 24K listeners in 6 months. Turns out honest iPhone videos beat expensive productions, and targeting real fans beats playlist schemes every time." - Proper Youth

## Your Takeaways

1. **Start with $500-1000/month**: You don't need huge budgets
2. **Test everything**: Your audience will surprise you
3. **Track attribution**: If you can't measure it, you can't improve it
4. **Volume beats perfection**: More content, more tests, more learning
5. **Build systems**: The "flywheel" compounds over time

## What's Next for Proper Youth?

- Maintaining 20K+ monthly listeners with $1,500/month spend
- Cart campaigns now generating 2.5x ROAS consistently
- Email list of 3,400 engaged fans
- Planning first profitable tour based on geo data

This isn't a miracle. It's not luck. It's just good engineering applied to music marketing.
