## 1. PhD Background Story (Complete)

### "From Lab to Studio: Why I Left Science to Fix Music Marketing"

I spent years in research labs optimizing materials at the molecular level. PhD in Materials Science & Engineering from University of Michigan (2015), double major in Physics and Mechanical Engineering from University of Arkansas (2010). Research Fellow at NIST, then VP of Engineering at an organic solar startup. I thought I'd spend my career perfecting atomic structures and building clean energy solutions.

But I had a problem.

I was also a musician. Released albums in 2006, 2012, and 2019 that got... tens of listeners.

_Tens._

There are billions of people in the world. I knew that even a tiny fraction who'd connect with my music could be an enormous audience. But somehow, incredible art was getting buried under completely inefficient systems.

In 2020, I decided to apply my engineering training to marketing Proper Youth's debut album, "So Close to Paradise." The hit single "Off My Mind" has since gained 1.8M streams - not because the music suddenly got better, but because I finally understood how to optimize the system around it.

Word spread. Every artist who reached out had been burned by the same expensive failures - playlist pitching services, publicists who delivered nothing, pay-for-play schemes, even fake streams. They'd spent thousands with nothing to show for it.

By 2022, I realized I was more excited about helping musicians market the right way than working on materials. The problem was the same - amazing potential getting lost in inefficient systems. The difference? In music, no one was applying engineering principles to fix it.

So I left my VP role to science the hell out of music marketing.

I built barely.ai from scratch - not just another dashboard, but a completely open-source platform where artists can see exactly how everything works. Started testing every assumption about how artists grow, treating each campaign like a controlled experiment.

My job isn't to be the star of your story. I'm the engineer who builds the stage, tunes the sound system, and optimizes the lighting so you can focus on what you do best: creating art that matters.

## 2. Client Case Studies Template

## CASE STUDY: Proper Youth - From 5,629 to 24,516 Monthly Listeners

### The Challenge

- **Starting Point:** 5,629 monthly Spotify listeners (April 2024)
- **Genre:** Indie Rock
- **Budget:** Started at $659/month, scaled to ~$2,000/month (non-cart ads)
- **Problem:** Years of releasing quality music with minimal reach. Tired of expensive publicists and playlist-pitching schemes that didn't deliver.

### The Strategy

**Progressive Campaign Building (April-October 2024):**

- **Months 1-2:** Started with playlist.spark and spotify.spark campaigns
- **Month 2:** Added ig.spark for Instagram growth
- **Months 3-4:** Layered in .charge campaigns (retargeting warm audiences)
- **September:** Launched cart.charge campaigns for merch sales

**Targeting Approach:**

- 40% US targeting
- 30% "green light" countries (US, CA, UK, AU, NZ)
- 30% "trigger" countries (lower-cost markets with engaged music fans)
- Age range: 18-46
- Broad genre + artist-specific targeting

**Content Strategy:**

- iPhone-shot "mimed" performance videos (no expensive productions)
- One monthly shooting day = 30+ days of content
- No cuts for easy editing
- 3-5 posts per day during peak months

### The Results

- **Ending Monthly Listeners:** 24,516 (October 2024)
- **Growth:** 335% increase in 6 months
- **Total Ad Spend:** $13,820 (April-October)
- **Merch Revenue:** $572 (Sept) → $2,510 (Oct) from cart campaigns
- **Cart Campaign ROAS:** 1.85-2.01x immediate return

### The Process

**The "Flywheel" Effect:**

1. See Instagram video → See another → "Discover" band on indie playlist
2. Click to Spotify → Get free CD offer → Join email list
3. Continuous testing: Test campaigns → Hero campaigns weekly optimization

**Key Success Factors:**

- No wasted money on playlist-pitching or publicists
- High-quality (not high-cost) iPhone videos consistently outperformed expensive productions
- Direct-to-fan advertising with clean attribution through barely.fm
- Building compound audiences that feed into each other

### Client Testimonial

"We spent years throwing money at playlist pitchers and publicists with nothing to show for it. Barely's scientific approach - testing what works, ditching what doesn't - took us from 5K to 24K listeners in 6 months. Turns out honest iPhone videos beat expensive productions, and targeting real fans beats playlist schemes every time."
