# Type and Lint Errors Checklist

## Errors to Fix

### 1. TypeScript Error - Missing Module
**File:** `apps/app/src/app/[handle]/flows/[flowId]/_components/flow-store.tsx`
**Line:** 26
**Error:** Cannot find module '@barely/lib/functions/flows/flow.layout' or its corresponding type declarations
**Fix:** This import needs to be updated to the correct path after the package reorganization

### 2. Lint Errors - Unsafe Type Assignments
**File:** `apps/app/src/app/[handle]/flows/[flowId]/_components/flow-store.tsx`

The following lines have unsafe type assignments:
- Line 420: Unsafe array destructuring of a tuple element with an error typed value
- Line 436: Unsafe return of a value of type error
- Line 453: Unsafe array destructuring of a tuple element with an error typed value
- Line 458: Unsafe array destructuring of a tuple element with an error typed value
- Line 471: Unsafe member access .id on an `error` typed value
- Line 477: Unsafe assignment of an error typed value
- Line 477: Unsafe member access .id on an `error` typed value
- Line 481: Unsafe member access .id on an `error` typed value
- Line 487: Unsafe assignment of an error typed value
- Line 487: Unsafe member access .id on an `error` typed value
- Line 705: Unsafe array destructuring of a tuple element with an error typed value
- Line 729: Unsafe member access .id on an `error` typed value
- Line 731: Unsafe assignment of an error typed value
- Line 731: Unsafe member access .id on an `error` typed value
- Line 737: Unsafe member access .id on an `error` typed value
- Line 738: Unsafe assignment of an error typed value
- Line 738: Unsafe member access .id on an `error` typed value
- Line 839: Unsafe assignment of an error typed value
- Line 839: Unsafe call of a(n) `error` type typed value
- Line 846: Unsafe spread of an error typed value in an array
- Line 847: Unsafe spread of an error typed value in an array

## Priority Order
1. Fix the missing module import (causing typecheck to fail)
2. Fix the unsafe type assignments in flow-store.tsx
