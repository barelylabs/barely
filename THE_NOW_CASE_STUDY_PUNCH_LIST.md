## ❓ What We Need From You

### 1. CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION (Review & Edit)

**Our draft:**

> "The Now had just released their debut album "Too Hot To Handle" - recorded at Real World Studios with Grammy-winning producer Oli Jacobs - but were stuck at around 1,000 monthly listeners. Despite strong local support in South Wales and sharing stages with legends like Placebo and Noel Gallagher, they couldn't break beyond their regional fanbase. They needed to build sustainable momentum for the album and expand their reach across the UK and into Europe."

**Question:** Does this accurately capture your situation before working with Barely? Any edits or additions?

### 2. STRATEGY ✅ (Updated with actual campaign details!)

**Final strategies:**

1. **Progressive Campaign Building** - Started with playlist.spark campaigns to build initial listeners, then layered in ig.spark to amplify organic content, followed by retargeting warm audiences with charge campaigns.

2. **Playlist Strategy** - Built your "ON THE ROAD" alt-rock playlist to 7K followers, creating a sustainable discovery channel for new fans.

3. **Track-Specific Push** - Focused campaigns behind "Get Out" drove major Discover Weekly placement, accelerating toward 225K streams.

4. **Free CD & Merch Launch** - Launched "pay what you want" CD campaign with autographed copies, converting engaged listeners into paying fans.

**Question:** Does this accurately capture the strategy? Any edits?

---

### 3. TIMELINE ✅ (Updated with actual month-by-month data!)

- **Months 1-2**: Launch playlist.spark campaigns → 2,241 → 4,187 listeners
- **Months 3-4**: Add ig.spark to amplify organic content → 4,187 → 10,230 listeners
- **Months 5-6**: Launch retargeting (ig.charge, spotify.charge) → 10,230 → 12,767 listeners
- **Month 7**: Discover Weekly boost for "Get Out" → 12,767 → 26,044 listeners
- **Month 8**: Launch CD/merch campaigns & gig promotion → 26,044 → 19,669 listeners

**Question:** Does this timeline look accurate?

### 4. KEY RESULTS ✅ (Updated with playlist + Discover Weekly wins!)

1. 1,360% growth in monthly listeners (1,347 → 19,669)
2. Monthly revenue grew from $16 to $1,059 (6,519% increase)
3. Built "ON THE ROAD" playlist to 7K followers

---

### 5. TESTIMONIAL (MOST IMPORTANT!)

**Our draft for your approval:**

> "We'd just released our debut album and were stuck at 1K listeners despite all the work we'd put in. Barely's approach was completely different from anything we'd tried - data-driven campaigns that actually built a real fanbase. The free CD campaign brought in genuine fans who actually showed up to gigs and bought merch. Going from $16 to over $1K in monthly revenue showed us this could actually be sustainable."

**Options:**

- **A)** Sign off on this as-is
- **B)** Edit this draft
- **C)** Write your own from scratch (preferred if you have time!)

**Attribution:**

- Should this be from a specific band member (e.g., "Shane Callaghan, The Now") or just "The Now"?
